### The tsv formatted posts that were randomly selected from the merged directory
Topics we have so far:

1. cabinet: Mentions the cabinet choice (of Biden).

2. economy\_climate: Any mention to the economy or climate. I chose to put these together in a single topic because they're very intertwined especially in the context of the 2020 election, as climate change is a pressing issue and the main resistence arguments are economical.

3. lawsuit: Any mention about legal challenges, vote fraud and disputes, etc.

4. covid: Mention about the coronavirus.

5. transition: Any post making a reference to the process of transitioning from Biden to Trump or its consequences, whether it's positive or negative.

6. dissatisfaction: Any form of condemnation or negative critique from one side about another.

7. vote: Any mention to vote counts, candidate certification or allusion to support for one candidate or another and that is not tied to the legal problems (see lawsuit).

8. 

Coding rule: Whenever two topics seem to apply to a given post, assign the most general possible topic.

  -Be as specific as possible, when u have 2 topics, 1 in the other, try to be as specific as possible
  -suppose that instead of cabinet and transition, suppose you have 2 candidates for coding but they are not included 1 in the other (coronavirus and enviornment), then you cannot apply the first rule, you need to find encoding that is more general, that can include both of these
