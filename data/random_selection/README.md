### The tsv formatted posts that were randomly selected from the merged directory
Topics we have so far:

1. cabinet: Mentions the cabinet choice (of Biden).

2. economy\_climate: Any mention to the economy or climate. I chose to put these together in a single topic because they're very intertwined especially in the context of the 2020 election, as climate change is a pressing issue and the main resistence arguments are economical.

3. lawsuit: Any mention about legal challenges, vote fraud and disputes, etc.

4. rallies: Not really sure about this one. The posts identified with this topic must reference Trump rallies.

5. transition: Any post making a reference to the process of transitioning from Biden to Trump, whether it's positive or negative

6. dissatisfaction: negative feeling about the election, no matter what is the reason (is it because Trump lost? Because of feeling that Biden stole the election? Are people dissatisfied with Trump's service in the last 4 years?)

7. vote: Any mention to vote counts, candidate certification or allusion to support for one candidate or another and that is not tied to the legal problems (see lawsuit).

8.
